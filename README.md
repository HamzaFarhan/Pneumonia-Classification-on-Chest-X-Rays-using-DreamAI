# Pneumonia-Classification-on-Chest-X-Rays-using-DreamAI
Using transfer learning implemented in DreamAI to train an image classification model to differentiate between normal chest x-rays and x-rays of patients with pneumonia.

DreamAI is an under development deep learning library written in Pytorch and inspired by FastAI.
This notebook is not a tutorial on DreamAI, it is just an example of how it can be used for image classification.
Stay tuned for a detailed overview/tutorial of DreamAI as well as other examples.

You can find the library here: https://github.com/fzaidi2014/dreamai

Any kind of feedback is much appreciated.
